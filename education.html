                    <p>Grade 4 - 10<br><br><br>Gems School was established in 1984 in Sanepa, Lalitpur with 78 students and 25 staff members. Initially, classes from Nursery to grade III were offered. Today, it has become a full-fledged higher secondary school running classes from grade one to twelve.

From 2077 it started running classes from one to ten in the new complex.</p>
